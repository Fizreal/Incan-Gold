    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rounds are played with a deck of 15 treasure cards (from 1-15 in value), 15 hazard cards (5 types x 3 ea) and
        an artifact.</li>
      <li>Each turn all players will decide if they want to continue in search of treasure, or leave and secure what
        they have collected.</li>
      <li>The value of a treasure card is evenly split between the players inside the temple, any remainder is left
        behind.</li>
      <li>Remaining treasure is claimed if a single player chooses to exit the temple, if multiple players leave the
        value is lost.</li>
      <li>If two hazard cards of the same type are played, the temple will collapse and any players still inside will
        lose the treasure they collect that round.</li>
      <li>Artifacts can only be claimed if a single player chooses to leave on the following turn, scoring the entire
        value.</li>
      <li>Whichever player has the highest total score after 5 rounds wins!</li>
    </ul>
