    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Incan Gold is played with a deck of 30 cards, 15 treasure cards (from 1-15 in value) and 15 hazard cards
        (5 types x 3 ea)</li>
      <li>Treasure is split evenly between all adventurers inside the temple, any remainder is left behind and can
        be claimed by the first person to exit alone</li>
      <li>If two hazard cards of the same type are played in the round, the temple will collapse, and players inside
        will lose the treasure they collected that round</li>
      <li>After each new card players will have the choice to continue exploring the temple, or return to the
        surface and end their play for the round to secure what they have collected</li>
      <li>Whichever player has the highest total score after 5 rounds wins!</li>
    </ul>
