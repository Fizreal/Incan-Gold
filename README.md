#### **_Description_**

Incan Gold is a push-your-luck game where you explore ancient incan temples in search of treasure. Each turn, players decide if they want to continue further into the temple or return to the surface and secure what they have collected, after which an event card will be played from the deck. Every treasure card will be split between the players who chose to venture deeper, but if hazard cards cause the temple to collapse while you are still inside you will lose all everything you've collected during the round.

The game plays over five rounds, and the player who finishes the game with the highest total score wins!
